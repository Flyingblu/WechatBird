# WechatBird

This is a forwarder from wechat to telegram. It is still under construction and unstable. But you are welcomed to test it out and share your issues and opinions with it! 

## Preparation

In order to get `WechatBird` working, you need to have python version at least 3.6 and install the following dependencies:

    $pip3 install itchat
    $pip3 install telepot
    $pip3 install pillow
    
Also, you will want to register your own bot from `BotFather`. Put your bot token and your own telegram id to `config.py`.
Then, you are ready to go!

## Running

You can run the script by just:

    $python3 main.py
    
Or you can use tmux or screen to run it at background.
